## Author's Note

The following file entails detail on my thoughts and the coding process for the game, later it will entail credits for free and open sources used in the game.

Some bases for the code can already be found in this repository (as of 17/7), but they will be gradually replaced with the final code files. 

This replacement will be noted via commit messages. 

Changes to the overall game and intentions will be noted in the following 

## Changelog

title change, AfterLife â†’ AfterDeath

After careful consideration of my goals for this game, I decided to rework the future intended features of the game. Namely focusing more on the user experience in fights and the overworld. Thus I will simplify the inventory system. 

I also decided on using filler texts for most of the NPCs and enemies for now, focusing on optimizing their behavior first and foremost. This will also be visible in some of the models used, a handful of which potentially remaining as filler models for the demo.
