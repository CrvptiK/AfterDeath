# Welcome to the pure Chaos in my Brain! \\(^-^)/

## Author's Note

The following file entails detail on my thoughts and the coding process for the game, later it will entail credits for free and open sources used in the game.

Some bases for the code can already be found in this repository (as of 17/7), but they will be gradually replaced with the final code files. 

This replacement will be noted via commit messages. 

Changes to the overall game and intentions will be noted in the following 

## Changelog

title change, AfterLife â†’ AfterDeath

After careful consideration of my goals for this game, I decided to rework the future intended features of the game. Namely focusing more on the user experience in fights and the overworld. Thus I will simplify the inventory system. 

I also decided on using filler texts for most of the NPCs and enemies for now, focusing on optimizing their behavior first and foremost. This will also be visible in some of the models used, a handful of which potentially remaining as filler models for the demo.

Focusing on finishing the dungeon, optimzing wiring, ux and ui. Thus the town will remain as relatively empty (working tilemap but no npc and no boss interaction (though you can find the boss stats in the code)). 
Both of these things might be projects for future learning. Some of my plans for this project, beyond the scope of what I can accomplish until the 15th include animated segments (cutscenes), an intro animation, a fully fleshed out boss interaction and puzzle aspect, before the boss fight and better graphics. 
All of this is beyond my current capacity, which is why this is not what I will be focusing on until after handing in the project.

Whether this can be viewed as a full demo, as of handing this in as my final project, remains questionable. I am proud of all the things I managed to build into the system and looking at the complexity of the code, as well as the hours upon hours of bugfixing and rewriting this, I am quite certain that this is a more than suitable final project. I am also looking forward to expanding this code in the future to have a full and proper demo to show. My goals were ambitious but I do think my result is a great (maybe not full but still very good) delievery. Although I would have loved to have a full working, high quality UI, I also understand that this is nothing I should be focusing on too much right now.

After working on this for at least 40 hours, I am very proud of what I accomplished. I started out without knowing how to create a simple map, now I have a code that automatically integrates images when they are named correctly. The game might now be visually stunning, but a few parts of the current UI do show its potential. Potential I will expand upon with time. I do hope nothing breaks while commiting everything. I will test it once as well. The map and overworld looks bland, but the item integration proves that the coding of it does not pose an issue.
