As my final project for my university Tech Basics 1 course, I present:

# AfterDeath

AfterDeath is a story-based **Adventure Game**, set in **Limworld**, a place for everyone seeking a second chance **after death**. 



The game revolves around **you**, the Player, who just awoke in this strange new world, seeking out magical artifacts to somehow find their way back to **Primworld**. 
The following can be seen as a Demo for the game, including main mechanics and functions, but only entailing the very first chapter of this story. 



**Enjoy!**
