As my final project for my university Tech Basics 1 course, I present:

# AfterDeath

AfterDeath is a story-based **Adventure Game**, set in **Limworld**, a place for everyone seeking a second chance **after death**. 
<br/><br/>
![Title Image AfterDeath](https://github.com/CrvptiK/AfterDeath/blob/main/assets/images/title.PNG)
<br/><br/>
The game revolves around **you**, the Player, who just awoke in this strange new world, seeking out magical artifacts to somehow find their way back to **Primworld**. 
The following can be seen as a Demo for the game, including main mechanics and functions, but only entailing a small taste of the combat and playstyle. 
<br/><br/>
A little later down the line this will consist of the full game demo (in 2030 or smth jk, jk).
<br/><br/>

**Enjoy!**
